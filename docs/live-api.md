### What is "Live API Endpoints"?

Live API Endpoints allow you to test your endpoints from within DRF docs. For each endpoints you can press the little *plug* icon which will bring up a modal with all the endpoint's fields and all the relevant information so that you can make a request instantly.

It is still in **beta** so if you face any problems - feel free to open an issue/pull request on GitHub.

The Live API is made with **[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)**. For more information on how to hack on them, check the README of the repository.
